# _Summary of the Minimum Operations_ #

## Problem:

A text file contains a single character "H".
You can only use two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste".
Given a target number "n", find the minimum number of operations to create a file with exactly "n" "H" characters.

## Method:

Define a function named minOperations(n).
Return Value:

The function should return an integer representing the minimum number of operations.
If it's impossible to achieve "n" "H" characters, return 0.

### Example:

To create 9 "H" characters, the minimum number of operations is 6:
H (initial)
Copy All -> Paste -> HH
Paste -> HHH
Copy All -> Paste -> HHHHHH
Paste -> HHHHHHHHH

## Key Points:

The goal is to optimize the operations for efficiency.
Consider the factors that affect the number of operations, such as the value of "n" and the way operations are combined.
