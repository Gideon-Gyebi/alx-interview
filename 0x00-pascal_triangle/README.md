Infinite triangular array of numbers.
Starts with 1 at the top, 1s on edges.
Each number generated by summing two above it.
Rich in patterns and properties:
Binomial coefficients for (x+y)^n.
Fibonacci sequence hidden in diagonals.
Sierpi≈Ñski gasket fractal from odd/even shading.
Applications in probability, combinatorics, algebra.
Fascinating puzzle with endless connections.
Very brief, yet brimming with detail!
